This is my attempt to follow /r/roguelikedev does the complete Python tutorial

I have no knowledge of programming, but i'm eager to learn python because it could open possibility at my work. And for fun!.

Engine.py Contains the main code for the game. For now, draw the background and a @ and call the function for moving.

input_handlers.py Contains the function to move (return dictionary (key + values) )
